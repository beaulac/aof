                        The thought of a thing is less like the thing itself than a web of small reminders of how it all
                        seemed at the time.
                        There are many connected factors that may influence Jumper’s bias toward a single truth that is
                        not a whole truth.

                        If Jumper were asked to recount his experience conducting the AoF seminar without the benefit of
                        his tedious, meticulated lineation, it would come forth from him more like this than his
                        otherwise presented Reconstruction.

                        It is impressions, not facts, that spread around the various lobes and folds, each one doing its
                        part to retain something close to a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, the mind does not bother to remember things rigidly, but rather in a malleable way,
                        ripe for ceaseless reinterpretation, so that we might grow and not stagna

                        So, it is because Mark Jumper fills the bareness of this Archive with his singular
                        interpretations that we can know it to be only as true as it is incomplete.
